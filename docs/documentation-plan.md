## Documentation Standards

### Format
All documentation should be created in Markdown format (.md) for easy version control and rendering in GitHub/GitLab. Documents should follow a consistent structure and include:

- Title and clear introduction
- Table of contents for longer documents
- Consistent heading structure (H1 for title, H2 for main sections, etc.)
- Code examples where appropriate
- Screenshots/diagrams where helpful
- Revision history at the end of each document

### Storage
All documentation should be stored in the `/docs` directory of the main repository with the following structure:
- `/docs/requirements/` - All requirements documentation
- `/docs/architecture/` - System architecture documentation
- `/docs/deployment/` - Deployment and maintenance documentation
- `/docs/testing/` - Testing documentation
- `/docs/user/` - End-user documentation
- `/docs/api/` - API documentation

### Review Process
1. Documentation should be reviewed as part of the pull request process
2. Technical accuracy should be verified by at least one technical team member
3. Clarity and usability should be verified by a non-technical team member when appropriate
4. Documentation should be updated alongside code changes

### Maintenance
- Documentation should be reviewed at least quarterly
- Each document should have a designated owner responsible for keeping it up to date
- A "Last Updated" date should be included at the end of each document
- Outdated documentation should be flagged for review in the project management system
