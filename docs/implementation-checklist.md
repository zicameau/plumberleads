## Progress Tracking

### Current Phase: Phase 1 → Phase 2 transition
### Status: Phase 1 Complete, Starting Phase 2
### Completed Items: 15/40

## Notes
- Authentication system fully implemented and tested
- Core error handling and middleware in place
- Test coverage at 90% for current implementation
- API versioning structure is in place
- Database schema and RLS policies defined
- Next focus: Lead management API implementation

## Risk Factors
- Supabase integration complexity (Mitigated with successful auth implementation)
- External service dependencies (Stripe, SMS, Email)
- Security requirements (Basic security measures in place)
- Performance optimization needs
- Testing coverage requirements (On track with 90% coverage)

## Success Criteria
- All checkboxes marked as complete
- Documentation fully updated
- Tests passing with required coverage (90% achieved for current scope)
- Security audit passed
- Performance metrics met
