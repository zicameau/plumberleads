All leads are verified for accuracy before being made available.

### Q: How much do leads cost?

- Estimated job value
- Geographic location
- Urgency level

Each lead displays its exact price before you claim it, typically ranging from $10-40 depending on these factors.

**A:** For transparency, we provide partial lead information before claiming, including:

Full contact details are provided only after claiming the lead.

### Q: What happens if I can't contact a lead after claiming it?

### Q: Is there a limit to how many leads I can claim?

**A:** We recommend contacting leads within 15-30 minutes of claiming them. Quick response times significantly increase your chances of securing the job, especially for emergency service requests.
