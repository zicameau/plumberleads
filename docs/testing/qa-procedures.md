## Defect Management

### Defect Lifecycle

1. **Identification**
   - QA identifies a potential defect
   - Verify it's reproducible and not a test error
   - Gather evidence (screenshots, logs, steps)

2. **Reporting**
   - Create defect report using Bug Report Template
   - Assign severity and priority
   - Link to related requirements or test cases
   - Submit defect in bug tracking system

3. **Triage**
   - Review defect in triage meeting
   - Confirm severity and priority
   - Assign to appropriate developer
   - Schedule for fix in appropriate sprint

4. **Resolution**
   - Developer investigates and fixes defect
   - Unit tests are updated if needed
   - Code review is performed
   - Code is checked in with reference to defect ID
   - Defect status is updated to "Fixed"

5. **Verification**
   - QA retests the defect
   - Verify fix works as expected
   - Check for regressions
   - Update defect status to "Verified" or "Reopened"

6. **Closure**
   - Defect is marked as "Closed"
   - Metrics are updated
   - Knowledge base is updated if needed

### Severity Classifications

| Severity | Description | SLA |
|----------|-------------|-----|
| Critical | System crash, data loss, security breach | Fix immediately, release blocker |
| High | Major function not working, no workaround | Fix before release |
| Medium | Function not working as expected, has workaround | Fix if time permits |
| Low | Minor issues that don't impact functionality | Fix in future release |

### Priority Classifications

| Priority | Description | Response Time |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| P1 | Blocking further testing or development | Immediate attention |
| P2 | Core functionality issue | Within 24 hours |
| P3 | Important but not critical | Current sprint |
| P4 | Nice to have | Future sprint |
